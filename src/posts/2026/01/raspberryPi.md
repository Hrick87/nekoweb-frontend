Its gonna take around 2 weeks for all the cables and power supply stuff to show up. Until then there won't be a comment section. I think I had some of this stuff at my old home but must've forgotten it or lost it because its not in the box with my raspberry pi. I definitely used the Pi for some small project years ago. Whoops! Oh well. In the meantime I'll look into fleshing out my music page I suppose. Looking forward to having everything streamable from there!
