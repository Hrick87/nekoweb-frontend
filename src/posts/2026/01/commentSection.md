My server is all set up and I've got my comment section fully locally hosted. I've opted for self hosting to avoid having a reliance on a thirdparty company. It's also much cheaper! If anyone out there on the indie web wants to know how I did it, drop me a comment here or email me. I kept things as simple as possible while still opting for security best practices. If I get enough people asking, I'll consider adding a tutorial to my site. I'm always happy to bring one more person closer to decentralizing the web.
