Hey ya'll, I'm getting close to having a proper comment section on my blog. I just need to move my server side files over to my raspberry pi and configure it a bit to get things going. Pretty soon as long as my place has power, you'll be able to post comments here! Typing that just made me realize I should probably find a way to cache the comments here so that already made comments are rendered client side maybe? This would be for if my raspberry pi went down... though tbh that might take up way too much space on NekoWeb's hosting service. idk something to think about. later
