                <p>Super hyped thats over with. My job paid me to go get the cert and it was stressing me out. I'm so happy to say I'm passed and can stop worrying about it.</p>

                <p>So I was under the impression that if I wanted to update my site immediately without importing a zip everytime I'd need to use nekoGit and subscribe monthly. Turns out theres an API with all sorts of nice features. That means I can post like this and have the post up in a matter of minutes. Thank god. Oh also dont forget to subscribe to my RSS feed, so you can see quality content like this.</p>

                <p>Learning Japanese has been tough. I might be going the hard route of wanting to know how to read all the Kanji for the N5 Vocabulary before moving on but I think it'll heavily benefit me.</p>
<p>Things are going well with Millenium, my TTRPG. I'm very close to having all the pages cleaned up. I've also finished writing up the first five out of ten levels of progression. Hopefully it sticks after playtesting. I'd like to release an open beta soon.</p>
<p>Oh also, I've developed some sorta wrist pain from my day job + drumming. I really do not want to give up drumming so I'm looking for solutions.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I got my girlfriend to try building her own site on Nekoweb and she's hooked! I can't wait to add her to my webring!</p>

            </br><h2>First blog post to kick off my website</h2>

                <p>Its Christmas day and I've finally got my blog feature on my website working. Further progress coming for my Millenium and Music pages.</p>
