    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Its gonna take around 2 weeks for all the cables and power supply stuff to show up. Until then there won&#39;t be a comment section. I think I had some of this stuff at my old home but must&#39;ve forgotten it or lost it because its not in the box with my raspberry pi. I definitely used the Pi for some small project years ago. Whoops! Oh well. In the meantime I&#39;ll look into fleshing out my music page I suppose. Looking forward to having everything streamable from there!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey ya&#39;ll, I&#39;m getting close to having a proper comment section on my blog. I just need to move my server side files over to my raspberry pi and configure it a bit to get things going. Pretty soon as long as my place has power, you&#39;ll be able to post comments here! Typing that just made me realize I should probably find a way to cache the comments here so that already made comments are rendered client side maybe? This would be for if my raspberry pi went down... though tbh that might take up way too much space on NekoWeb&#39;s hosting service. idk something to think about. later&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was under the impression that if I wanted to update my site immediately without importing a zip everytime I&#39;d need to use nekoGit and subscribe monthly. Turns out theres an API with all sorts of nice features. That means I can post like this and have the post up in a matter of minutes. Thank god. Oh also dont forget to subscribe to my RSS feed, so you can see quality content like this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Learning Japanese has been tough. I might be going the hard route of wanting to know how to read all the Kanji for the N5 Vocabulary before moving on but I think it&#39;ll heavily benefit me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are going well with Millenium, my TTRPG. I&#39;m very close to having all the pages cleaned up. I&#39;ve also finished writing up the first five out of ten levels of progression. Hopefully it sticks after playtesting. I&#39;d like to release an open beta soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh also, I&#39;ve developed some sorta wrist pain from my day job + drumming. I really do not want to give up drumming so I&#39;m looking for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I got my girlfriend to try building her own site on Nekoweb and she&#39;s hooked! I can&#39;t wait to add her to my webring!&lt;/p&gt;
